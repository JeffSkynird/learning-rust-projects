This repository is a personal space to practice Rust by building small, focused projects. It serves as a sandbox to experiment with language features, tooling, and common patterns in command-line applications and beyond.

## ðŸ“¦ Projects

- ðŸ§® mycalc: A simple command-line calculator built with the `clap` crate for argument parsing. It showcases basic CLI structure, flags/arguments, and error handling.
  - ðŸ“‚ Path: `./mycalc`

- ðŸ”Ž mini-grep: A tiny grep-like text searcher supporting regex, recursive search, glob filtering, line numbers, whole-word matches, ANSI color, and .gitignore awareness.
  - ðŸ“‚ Path: `./mini-grep`

ðŸ“˜ Each project will get its own dedicated README with usage details and examples over time. This top-level README stays brief and points to the individual projects.
